This is my code and answers for questions in the Advanced R (2nd edition) [book](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/index.html)

## Motivation

There currently exists an amazing [Advanced R Solutions book](https://advanced-r-solutions.rbind.io/) with clearly worked answers. This workbook retreads the same steps, while applying a more functional coding style. In English - more piping, fewer side effects. I also just like learning R :)
