# Quiz section

## Quiz 1

Given the following data frame, how do I create a new column called "3" that contains the sum of 1 and 2? You may only use `$`, not `[[`. What makes 1, 2, and 3 challenging as variable names?

```{r Quiz 1 Q}
df <- data.frame(runif(3), runif(3))
names(df) <- c(1, 2)
```


### Answer

1 and 2 and 3 are challenging as var names since they are non-syntactic names. Though they can still be used (here) via coercing:

```{r Quiz 1 A}
df$`3` <- df$`1` + df$`2`

head(df)

```

## Quiz 2

In the following code, how much memory does y occupy?

```{r Quiz 2 Q}
x <- runif(1e6)
y <- list(x, x, x)

```

### Answer

y takes slightly more memory than x, but not 3 times more (only 80 bytes). This is because y is a list containing 3 references to the 1 vector underlying x. List structure takes up 80 bytes, the vector takes up 8MB.

```{r Quiz 2 A}
lobstr::obj_size(x)
lobstr::obj_size(y)
lobstr::obj_size(y) - lobstr::obj_size(x)

```

## Quiz 3

On which line does a get copied in the following example?

```{r Quiz 3 Q}
a <- c(1, 5, 3, 2)
b <- a
b[[1]] <- 10

```

### Answer

Line 3 of previous block `b[[1]] <- 10`, since that is when `b` is modified and a new vector is created to contain data that b points to.

# Binding basics Exercises

## Ex. 1

Explain the relationship between `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` in the following code:

```{r Ex 2.2.1}
# a points to a vector (probably ALTREP)
a <- 1:10

# b points to the same vector as a 
b <- a

# c points to the same vector as b, and hence the same as a 
c <- b

# d points to the same vector as a (since their definition are the same)
d <- 1:10

# Proof
lobstr::obj_addr(a)
lobstr::obj_addr(b)
lobstr::obj_addr(c)
lobstr::obj_addr(d)

```

## Ex. 2

The following code accesses the mean function in multiple ways. Do they all point to the same underlying function object? Verify this with `lobstr::obj_addr()`.

```{r eval = FALSE}
mean
base::mean
get("mean")
evalq(mean)
match.fun("mean")
```

### Answer
All points to the same function

```{r}
mean |>
  lobstr::obj_addr()

base::mean |>
  lobstr::obj_addr()

get("mean") |>
  lobstr::obj_addr()

evalq(mean) |>
  lobstr::obj_addr()

match.fun("mean") |>
  lobstr::obj_addr()


```

## Ex. 3

By default, base R data import functions, like `read.csv()`, will automatically convert non-syntactic names to syntactic ones. Why might this be problematic? What option allows you to suppress this behaviour?

### Answer

Because they by default creates factors out of character vectors. This may be problematic if a factor level is completely missing from the imported dataset.

```{r}
#| eval: false
?read.csv
```

Set `as.is = TRUE` for safety.

## Ex. 4
What rules does `make.names()` use to convert non-syntactic names into syntactic ones?

### Answer

```{r}
#| eval: false
?make.names
```

- Prepend `X` if first character is invalid
- Translate all invalid characters to `.`
- Append `.` if name matches R keyword
- Deduplicate names

The function itself is written in `C`; I don't know how to understand `C` yet.

```{r}
make.names
```

# Object size Exercises

## Ex. 1

In the following example, why are `object.size(y)` and `obj_size(y)` so radically different? Consult the documentation of `object.size()`.

```{r}
y <- rep(list(runif(1e4)), 100)

object.size(y)
obj_size(y)

```

### Answer

This is because `object.size(y)` does not take into account the degree of memory sharing in the list.

## Ex. 2

Take the following list. Why is its size somewhat misleading?

```{r}
funs <- list(mean, sd, var)
obj_size(funs)

```

### Answer

Because `mean`, `sd`, `var` are base R functions; the list does not contain exact copies, but only references. As in Ex. 1, this would be shown via `object.size()` and `obj_size()`

```{r}
object.size(funs)
obj_size(funs)

```

## Ex. 3

Predict the output of the following code:

```{r echo=TRUE}
a <- runif(1e6)

# This will be 8MB, which is total size of a
obj_size(a)

b <- list(a, a)

# This will be 8MB, which is mostly size of a 
obj_size(b)

# This will be 8MB, which is mostly size of a
obj_size(a, b)

b[[1]][[1]] <- 10

# This will be 16MB, which is mostly size of modified b[[1]] and 
# unmodified b[[2]] pointing to a
obj_size(b)

# This will be 16MB, which is mostly size of modified b[[1]] and 
# unmodified b[[2]] pointing to a
obj_size(a, b)

b[[2]][[1]] <- 10

# This will be 16MB, which is mostly size of modified b[[1]] and 
# modified b[[2]]
obj_size(b)

# This will be 24MB, which is mostly size of a, modified b[[1]], and 
# modified b[[2]]
obj_size(a, b)

```
